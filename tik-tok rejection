Tik-Tok (North America): Verdict-> Rejected after two rounds [11-feb-2022]

1st round(2 questions) [45 min]: 
1. Find elements that are not present in a range of Low and High 
nums=[2,4,7,9,100] , low = 0, high=102
Ans: [“1”,”3”,”5->6”,”8”,”10->99”,”101”]
Analysis: Was able to come to a solution with minor edge cases that need to handle O(N)

2. Find the largest size of BST in a binary tree
Analysis: Just need to explain the logic. Was able to explain from bottom to top approach in O(N) time.

2nd round(2 questions)  [45 min]: 
1. Check X and Y are cousins or not in Tree containing unique elements [x and y should be at the same height and the parent of x and y should be different]
Analysis: At the start little bit messed up but was able to come up with O(N) solution by writing a function that helps me to find the parent and height of any node.
By calling this function for x and y..I compared height and parent condition for the result

2. Arrange the team from winner to looser
Given arr=[“ABC”,”ACB”,”ABC”,”ACB”,”ACB”]
Ans: “ACB”
Explain: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as a first-place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters
So, C will be at 2nd place and B will be at 3rd place.
Analysis: I came up with a brute force solution by counting the frequency of every team are every position
Position 1 -> A(5), B(0), C(0)
Position 2 -> A(0), B(2), C(3)
Position 3 -> A(0), B(3), C(2)
